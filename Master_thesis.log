You have the following alternatives:     1.  Store your variables more efficiently; see help compress.  (Think of Stata's data area         as the area of a rectangle; Stata can trade off width and length.)     2.  Drop some variables or observations; see help drop.     3.  Increase the amount of memory allocated to the data area using the set memory command;         see help memory.r(901);end of do-filer(901);
