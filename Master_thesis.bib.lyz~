We isolate five influences that discriminate reasonably well between the slow-and fast-growers: a conditional convergence effect, whereby a country grows faster if it begins with lower real per-capita {GDP} relative to its initial level of human capital in the forms of educational attainment and health; a positive effect on growth from a high ratio of investment to {GDP} (although this effect is weaker than that reported in some previous studies); a negative effect from overly large government; a negative effect from government-induced distortions of markets; and a negative effect from political instability. Overall, the fifted growth rates for 85 countries for 1965{\textendash}1985 had a correlation of 0.8 with the actual values. We also find that female educational attainment has a pronounced negative effect on fertility, whereas female and male attainment are each positively related to life expectancy and negatively related to infant mortality. Male attainment plays a positive role in primary-school enrollment ratios, and male and female attainment relate positively to enrollment at the secondary level.},

	abstract = {This paper sheds light on two problems in the Penn World Table ({PWT)} {GDP} estimates. First, we show that these estimates vary substantially across different versions of the {PWT} despite being derived from very similar underlying data and using almost identical methodologies; that this variability is systematic; and that it is intrinsic to the methodology deployed by the {PWT} to estimate growth rates. Moreover, this variability matters for the cross-country growth literature. While growth studies that use low frequency data remain robust to data revisions, studies that use annual data are less robust. Second, the {PWT} methodology leads to {GDP} estimates that are not valued at purchasing power parity ({PPP)} prices. This is surprising because the raison d'{\^e}tre of the {PWT} is to adjust national estimates of {GDP} by valuing output at common international (purchasing power parity [{PPP])} prices so that the resulting {PPP-adjusted} estimates of {GDP} are comparable across countries. We propose an approach to address these two problems of variability and valuation.},

The authors have undertaken a major revision for the long-awaited second edition of thiswidely used text, the first modern textbook devoted to growth theory. The book has been expanded inmany areas and incorporates the latest {research.After} an introductory discussion of economic growth,the book examines neoclassical growth theories, from Solow-Swan in the 1950s and Cass-Koopmans inthe 1960s to more recent refinements; this is followed by a discussion of extensions to the model,with expanded treatment in this edition of heterogenity of households. The book then turns toendogenous growth theory, discussing, among other topics, models of endogenous technologicalprogress (with an expanded discussion in this edition of the role of outside competition in thegrowth process), technological diffusion, and an endogenous determination of labor supply andpopulation. The authors then explain the essentials of growth accounting and apply this framework toendogenous growth models. The final chapters cover empirical analysis of regions and empiricalevidence on economic growth for a broad panel of countries from 1960 to 2000. The updated treatmentof cross-country growth regressions for this edition uses the new Summers-Heston data set on worldincome distribution compiled through 2000.},

The aggregate indicators are based on several hundred individual underlying variables, taken from a wide variety of existing data sources. The data reflect the views on governance of survey respondents and public, private, and {NGO} sector experts worldwide. The {WGI} also explicitly report margins of error accompanying each country estimate. These reflect the inherent difficulties in measuring governance using any kind of data. Even after taking these margins of error into account, the {WGI} permit meaningful cross-country and over-time comparisons.},
