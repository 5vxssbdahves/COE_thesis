Is there some action a government of India could take that would lead the
 Indian economy to grow like Indonesia’s or Egypt’s? If so, what, exactly?
 If not, what is it about the “nature of India” that makes it so? The consequenc

 Once one starts to think about them, it is hard to think about anything

Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This paper will look at the effect of different institutional measures and
 indicators on economic growth by comparing the POLCON indicators 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "henisz2000theinstitutional"

\end_inset

, the PRS Group's International Country Risk Guide indicators, and the democracy
 indicators from POLITY IV 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "marshall2011polityiv"

\end_inset

.
 The main econometric models are partly based on the work by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 Covering a broad range of institutional indicators, this paper uses a very
 wide definition of institutions as any structures that in some way or another
 influence human behaviour or interaction.
 In this sense, it attempts to look at the probably myriad of aspects alluded
 to in the quote above, when the Lucas asks what is special about the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In a broader perspective, the effect of institutions on economic growth
 is interesting to investigate because these are the structures that shape
 actors of individuals.
 In particular, this paper looks at institutions that constrain political
 executives in the sense of how much discretion they have in relation to
 their ideal political stance.
 Extending the idea of constraining democratic rulers, the interesting question
 is to what extent the institutional structures in which decision-makers
 find themselves have an influence on the level of economic progress of
 a given country.
 The overall objective of such efforts would thus to close in on what could
 be changed in the institutional environment of countries that facilitates
 a greater degree of economic progress.
 Moreover, understanding which institutional measures and indicators are
 more highly correlated with economic growth hopefully helps us to guide
 us towards a better encapsulation of what the institutional characteristics
 are that are most influential in fostering economic growth.
 Efforts to unravel the ways in which the institutional environment affects
 economic growth is a contribution to the fundamental question posed by
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 in the opening quote of this paper.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Understanding how different ways of measuring institutions is also important
 because institutional quality associated with absorption capacity, which
 in turn is significant for the returns of any investment.
 In this way, as will also be discussed further in the literature review
 section, the institutional environment of a given country is an important
 factor in determining not only direct effects on growth, but also indirectly
 through being instrumental in fostering other phenomena that in turn influence
 economic growth.

Hypotheses and Research Objectives
\begin_inset CommandInset label

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The overarching hypothesis of this paper is that the institutional factors
 of a given country has a significant influence on the degree to which this
 country experiences economic growth and development.
 This broad hypothesis can be divided into a number of specific hypotheses
 related to the institutional indicators used:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The degree to which political executives are constrained in their ability
 carry through their preferred policy as measured by the POLCON indicators
 is positively correlated with economic growth.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
The indicator POLCONIII is positively correlated with economic growth.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The indicator POLCONV, which includes two additional veto points (the judiciary
 and the sub-federal entities), is positively correlated with economic growth.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The indicator POLCONVJ, which includes measures of alignment and fractionalizati
on of the High Court, is positively related to economic growth.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
The degree of bureaucratic quality as measured by ICRG indicators is positively
 correlated with economic growth.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
The composite indicator of bureaucratic quality has a larger effect on economic
 growth than the only one of the components, namely rule of law.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
The relationship between democracy and economic growth can be captured by
 a concave function.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When we talk about a positive correlation in the hypotheses above, we naturally
 refer to the partial effects of these variables, i.e.
 holding other factors constant that might also affect economic growth.
 The control variables included in the model presented in this paper will
 be presented in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Control-Variables"

\end_inset

 below.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Apart from the specific hypotheses mentioned above a more subtle objective
 of this paper is to see whether it is possible to replicate the findings
 of Henisz (2000).
 The data set has been collected completely from the sources, so a large
 part of the effort of working on this paper has been to work out where
 data comes from, how it has been transformed, merged together, analysed
 etc.
 As

 to replicate quantitative studies 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

is usually a lot harder than it should be and always more valuable than
 it seems at the outset.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 as contributions in themselves.
 Hence, another objective of this paper is to confirm that the results obtained
 by Henisz are possible to replicate, which will be discussed in section

Determining which way the causality runs when looking at the influence of
 institutions on economic growth is a contentious topic.
 The question is whether democratic institutions cause economic growth,
 i.e.
 that countries with a higher degree of democracy are more prone to economic
 progress compared to countries with more autocratic characteristics, or
 whether countries that are more economically developed are more likely
 to foster democratic institutions.
 A simple, but compelling test can be undertaken by looking at the Korean
 Peninsula.
 Looking at the divergent paths of North and South Korea there is evidence
 that democratic institutions cause economic growth and not vice versa.
 Economic progress of South Korea result of institutional path chosen after
 the end of the war in 1953

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another topic that is important to tackle in understanding the institutional
 influence on economic growth is how institutions are measured.
 Glaeser et al.
 (2004) looks at three measures of institutions, namely risk of appropriation,
 quality of government and constraints on the executive.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, even before one decides on how to measures institutions, they must
 defined.
 A concise and precise notion of institutions is that they are in essence
 constraints (North 1981, quoted in Glaeser et al.
 2004) and that they are permanent or stable (Glaeser et al.
 2004, quoted in Voigt, 2013, p.
 3).
 The frequently used measures such as those from the International Country
 Risk Guide, the Governance Indicators from the World Bank 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "kaufmann2010theworldwide"

\end_inset

 and the Polity IV measures.
 Glaeser et al.
 argues that these do neither measure the stability of institutions nor
 their constraints, but only policy outcomes 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
after "p. 4"
key "voigt2013hownot"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another terminological distinction is between economic and political institution
s.
 Voigt (2013, p.
 7) proposes to see economic institutions as enabling and political institutions
 as constraining.
 Institutions can also be formal or informal, public or private, 
\emph on
de jure 
\emph default
or 
\emph on
de facto
\emph default
, internal or external
\emph on
 
\emph default
(Voigt, 2013, pp.
 6-8).
 Institutions also increase the level of predictability in a given society
 given incentives to make long-term investments.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Human capital and constraints on the executive are both associated with
 economic growth, but Glaeser et al.
 argues that human capital is a stronger predictor.
 The two might however be related as higher levels of education in a given
 society could result in electoral demands that the executive be further
 constrained...
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "voigt2013hownot"

\end_inset

 looks at how institutions should not be measured and presents a number
 of proposals on how to measure institutions.
 Voigt raises four points concerning the measurement of institutions of
 which two are worth mentioning:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
the traditional aggregate measures such as ‘the rule of law’ are too vague
 to contain meaningful information, so measures of institutions should refer
 to specific institutions; and
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
although many established measures of institutions are subjective such as
 the World Bank indicators and the Quality of Government indicators, the
 objective measures are generally preferable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Moreover, to summarise the current consensus on the topic, the paper proposes
 that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

institutions matter crucially for economic development

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One of the conclusions of Glaeser et al.
 (2004) is that some of the work purporting to measure the influence of
 institutions on economic growth has not measured institutions, but rather
 policies 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
after "p. 2"
key "voigt2013hownot"

\end_inset

.
 In addition, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "easterly2005national"

\end_inset

 argues that the effects of national politics on economic growth are only
 modest.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Institutions might be difficult to measure.
 One of the attempts to overcome this measurement problem was done by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "acemoglu2000thecolonial"

\end_inset

, who explored how differences in mortality rates can used as an instrument
 for estimating the effect of institutions on economic growth.
 They equate institutions with secure property rights.
 They then go on to argue that countries with this institution in place
 will invest more in physical and human capital, because the returns on
 the investment is more or less certain.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This leads us to another controversy in the literature concerns whether
 democratic institutions serve as mechanisms for ensuring property rights,
 thus encouraging investment and economic growth, or whether increased levels
 of human capital lead to democratic institutions.
 In essence, the question is whether democratic institutions are the cause
 or consequence of economic growth.
 This is at least how the controversy is presented in Voigt (2013).
 On closer inspection the argument seems to lend itself to another interpretatio
n, namely that the views are in fact not conflicting, but complementary:
 it might both be true that human capital lead to democratic institutions
 and that democratic institutions lead to economic growth.
 The relevant question is rather whether democratic institutions lead to
 higher levels of human capital or vice versa.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Human capital and democratic institutions understood as constraints on the
 executive are both associated with economic growth, but Glaeser et al.
 (2004) argues that human capital is a stronger predictor, although they
 do not discredit the other camp that purports that democratic institutions
 are the main predictor 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
after "p. 3"
key "voigt2013hownot"

\end_inset

.
 Glaeser et al.
 (2004) challenges the use of instrumental variables used in the works by
 Acemoglu among others to predict economic development of settler colonies
 in the US.
 They argue that human capital is a more reliable predictor of economic
 growth than institutions per se.
 The settlers brought themselves rather than their institutions.

 If discretionary fiscal policy has an effect on economic growth, but fiscal
 policy is in turn influenced by the level of political constraints, then
 we have to be careful to bear in mind that there is an intermediating factor

 This overall indicator is then interacted with the initial level of GDP

 Thus, in accordance with the conditional convergence hypothesis, we expect
 this variable to be negatively related to economic growth.

We view the black-market premium on foreign exchange as a proxy for market

 to external shocks, such as changes in the terms of trade.
 (The black-market premium is also a desirable variable because it is objectivel

 Specifically, the test in Appendix 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
ref{timeeffects}
\end_layout

\end_inset

, show that we must probably have time effects.
 The error component in equation (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:pooling"

\end_inset

) above can be separated into a several components depending on which effects
 we believe we have.
 In equation (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:poolingweffects"

\end_inset

) below we have separated the error component into two parts reflecting
 the different components we are testing for.
 The first component, 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{t}$
\end_inset

 is a time effect that only changes across time and 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon_{it}$
\end_inset

 is the idiosyncratic error component:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
y_{it}=\alpha+\beta^{T}x_{it}+\lambda_{t}+\epsilon_{it},\label{eq:poolingweffects}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The idiosyncratic error is assumed to be independent from 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{it}$
\end_inset

 and the other error component.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{t}$
\end_inset

 is correlated with the regressors, the OLS estimator for 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 is inconsistent, so we proceed to a fixed effects model where they are
 treated as parameters to be estimated.
 There are good reasons to believe that this is the case, because it is
 likely that the factors we are not controlling for in the regression that
 varies across time are correlated with some of the regressors.
 Another way to ascertaining whether we should use a fixed effects model
 rather than a simple pooled model is to test for poolability by comparing
 a pooled model with the effects that are included based on the previous
 tests to see whether we should progress to a fixed effects (within) model.
 The results of these tests (see Appendix

 the countries.

 The following analysis will primarily look at the results obtained with

\begin_layout Subsection
Hypothesis 1: POLCON Indicators
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
POLCONIII
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Henisz finds a positive and significant coefficient on POLCON (he does not
 distinguish between POLCONIII and POLCONV as this paper, because this distincti
on was developed in a later data set of POLCON) in both the OLS, GLS and
 GMM models.
 If we start looking at the pooled OLS model with time effects, we see that
 POLCONIII surprisingly has a small negative, albeit insignificant coefficient.
 In the fixed effects model both POLCONIII is now insignificantly negative.
 In the GLS model with time effects, the coefficient on POLCONIII is significant
ly positive, while it turns significantly negative in the GLS model with
 individual effects.
 All in all, we have quite inconclusive evidence as to whether the hypothesis
 can be maintained, but according to the models investigated here, there
 is more evidence to support a rejection of the hypothesis that higher constrain
ts on the political executive have a positive influence on economic growth.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
POLCONV
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The POLCONV adds to additional veto points to the POLCONIII measure at the
 sub-federal and judicial level.
 On our fixed effects model with time effects we again have a insignificant
 negative coefficient, while it is positive in the pooled model, albeit
 still insignificant.
 As we can see in table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Coefficients-of-POLCONV"

\end_inset

, in both FGLS models we have a positive and significant coefficent, which
 lends support to the conclusion that we cannot reject that this measure
 of political constraints have a positive effect on economic growth.

The second assumption is that we have a random sample from the cross section.
 Already this assumption might be violated, because it is probably not random
 for which countries we have data.
 That is to say that the countries for which we do not have data may have
 a significant impact on the results if included in the analysis.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another assumption is that there exist no perfect linear relationship among
 the explanatory variables.
 As mentioned in the section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

, there is strong correlation among the individual measures of institutional
 quality and political constraint, so these are not included at the same

Having outlined the results of the estimation in the previous section, we

\begin_layout Standard
Firstly, there are several ways of measuring progress, which might not only
 be economic, but also social or any combination of the two along other
 factors.
 This paper has taken the traditional approach of using the growth rate
 of real GDP per capita in constant prices, but there are a number of alternativ
es such as to use the Human Development Indicators from the UN or the report
 by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 on the measurement of economic performance and social progress.
 It would thus have been interesting to see

\begin_layout Standard
The results might also be influenced by omitted variable bias.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As mentioned in the introduction to 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

reference "sec:Statistical-Models"

\end_inset

 section, other statistical estimation methods such as GMM could have been
 used to make the estimates more reliable and valid.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Looking at the constraints of political executives, the bureaucratic quality,
 democratic measures etc.
 might miss an important aspect of the institutional environment conducive
 to growth such as looking at the specific incentive structures that politicians
 and other decision-makers face.
 As the following quote from 
\emph on
The Economist
\emph default
 newspaper illustrates, there is a growing issue of whether politicians
 do indeed have the proper incentive structures to act in ways that are
 favourable to economic growth:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
“(...) many politicians are being shockingly irresponsible.
 In different ways, politicians’ actions (or inaction) are the biggest short-ter
m danger facing the American, European and Chinese economies.
 Judging by politicians’ current behaviour, the world economy could slow
 a lot further.
 It could even tip into recession in 2013.”

, but this is unfortunately also only available from 2008.
 Given that many of the indicators on institutional quality are only available
 from relatively recently, it would be interesting to conduct further analysis
 into looking at whether it would possible to find any significant relationships
 between economic growth and these institutional variables in the shorter
 term.

\begin_layout Standard
In this project we have tested whether political constraints or institutional
 factors, or both, affect economic growth.
 We have found a statistical significant estimator of the measure of political
 constraints POLCONV and the democracy index provided by PolityIV when using
 fixed effects estimation allowing for individual effects using a number
 of control variables.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Further efforts in this vein, could look at (partial; 
\emph on
ceteris paribus
\emph default
) relationship between political constraints and economic growth, which
 could be argued is concave such that it is initially important up to a
 point wherefrom it becomes detrimental to economic growth.
 Other interesting variables might include trust or failure tolerance of
 a country.
